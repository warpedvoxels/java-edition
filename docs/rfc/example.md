# My feature

## Summary

A simple explanation of the feature.

## Motivation or/and use cases

The reason why this feature should be added and its use cases, or what problems it would solve or what experience
it can provide to users.

## User-facing explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included and you were teaching it to a user. This usually means:
* Introduce new named concepts;
* Explaining the feature, its purpose, and its limitations;
* Explaining the use cases;
* Explaining the impact of the feature on the user experience;
* If applicable, explain how this feature compares to other similar features;

## Implementation strategy

This is the tecnical portion of the RFC. Try to capture the broad implementation strategy, and then focus in
on the tricky details so that:
* Its interactions with other features are clear;
* It is clear how the feature would be implemented;

When necessary, this section should return to the examples given in the previous sections and explain the
implementation details that make them work. When writing this section, try to keep the examples as simple as
possible or be mindful of the complexity of the implementation. Remember that:
* **RFC should avoid ambiguity**: if the implementation is unclear, it should be clarified in the implementation
  section. Two developers implementing the same RFC should agree on the same implementation.
* **RFCs should be "implementable"**: Merged RFCs should only depend on features from other merged RFCs and
  existing features. It is ok to create multiple dependent RFCs, but they should either be merged at the same
  time or have a clear merge order that ensures the "implementable" rule is respected.

## Alternatives and drawbacks

* There is any disavantage to this proposal? If yes, explain it and how it would be solved.
* Which technical contraints are we pushing up against, if any?
* Which design considerations are we pushing up against, if any?
* Which product area (programming, design, etc.) is this proposal relevant to?
